  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>A popular Italian dish, lasagna is made of stacked layers of pasta sheets,
    alternating with fillings such as ground meats and tomato sauce, b√©chamel
    sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella, and
    Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.</p>
  <p>Often topped with grated cheese, the dish is baked in an oven, before
    being cut into single-serving square or rectangular portions.</p>
